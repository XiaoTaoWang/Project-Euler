About Project Euler
*******************
(Pasted from the Project Euler homepage)
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will
require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive
at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required
to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for
the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational
context.

Inspiration
***********
I heard about Project Euler completely by accident. I was fascinated by the beauty features of
amicable numbers, and there happened to be a related problem(`Problem 21 <https://projecteuler.net/problem=21>`_)
distributed by Project Euler. Project Euler shows a new world to me, a world of mathematics and
algorithm, full of unknowns and miracles. It's so attractive that I can't stop myself exporing it.

In the beginning, I just solved those problems and uploaded my Python solutions named with
the official problem indices. However, as I approached, I found the problems are not independent
and many are closely related each other, so I reorganized the work and categorized the problems
(and also solutions). After that, ah, doesn't it like a gallery, a space for my little programs,
themed with the art of computer programming?

So, enjoy yourselfÔºÅ
